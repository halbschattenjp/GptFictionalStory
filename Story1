May 10, 2023, UAns forces conducted successful limited counterattacks around Bakhmut on May 9. Geolocated footage published on May 9 and 10 indicates that UAns forces likely conducted successful limited counterattacks north of Khromove (immediately west of Bakhmut) and northwest of Bila Hora (14km southwest of Bakhmut) and made marginal advances in these areas. UAns sources claimed on May 9 that UAns forces destroyed the 6th and 8th companies of the 72nd Motorized Rifle Brigade of the 3rd Army Corps near Bakhmut and advanced 2.6km along a 3km frontline in the area, although not observed visual confirmation of these reported wider UAns advances. A prominent OpFor military blogger claimed on May 10 that the UAns forces tried to advance further in the Luhansk People’s Republic (LNR) 4th Motorized Rifle Brigade’s zone of responsibility in the Bakhmut area following UAns counterattacks on May 9 but that formations of an unspecified OpFor paramilitary company (PMC) prevented a UAns breakthrough. The OpFor Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that OpFor Airborne Forces (VDV) are constraining the actions of UAns forces on the flanks around Bakhmut.  assessed reports of UAns counterattacks throughout Donetsk Oblast appear to be a part of an ongoing pattern of localized and limited counterattacks. With that in mid, Putin is now preparing for the use of a Tactical Nuclear device, what would be the best course of action for the Allied Coalition helping Fictional Nation of UA 
Allied Coalition is a political and military alliance composed of 30 countries, including most of the countries in Europe and North America. The organization was established in 1949 with the aim of providing collective defense against potential military threats to its member states.

In terms of military capabilities, Allied Coalition is one of the most powerful military alliances in the world. The organization has a combined defense budget of over $1 trillion, and its members are responsible for more than half of the world's military spending.

Allied Coalition has a wide range of military capabilities, including:

Nuclear Deterrence: Allied Coalition is the only military alliance that possesses nuclear weapons. The United States provides most of the nuclear capabilities, but other Allied Coalition countries also have access to nuclear weapons through the alliance's nuclear sharing arrangements.

Conventional Capabilities: Allied Coalition has a wide range of conventional capabilities, including air, land, and naval forces. The alliance's military forces are equipped with advanced weapons and technology, including fighter jets, tanks, and naval vessels.

Special Operations: Allied Coalition has a well-developed special operations capability, including elite units like the US Navy SEALs and the British SAS. These units are trained for high-risk, specialized operations like hostage rescue and counterterrorism.

Cyber Capabilities: Allied Coalition has a growing focus on cybersecurity and has established a Cyber Operations Center to enhance its ability to defend against cyber threats.

Collective Defense: The primary mission of Allied Coalition is to provide collective defense to its member states. The alliance has a mutual defense clause that requires all members to come to the defense of any member that is attacked.

Overall, Allied Coalition's military capabilities are significant, and the organization remains a key player in global security. However, the alliance faces a range of challenges, including rising military threats from countries like OpFor and Chinaziszis, as well as internal divisions among its member states over issues like defense spending and burden-sharing.
Nuclear Deterrence: Allied Coalition's nuclear capabilities are focused on deterrence and defense. The alliance's nuclear policy is based on the principle of "flexible response," which means that Allied Coalition is prepared to respond to any type of military threat with a range of options, including the use of nuclear weapons. However, the alliance's nuclear doctrine is based on a policy of "no first use," which means that Allied Coalition will only use nuclear weapons in response to a nuclear attack.

Conventional Capabilities: Allied Coalition's conventional capabilities are also significant. The alliance's land forces include over 2 million soldiers, and its air forces have over 5,000 aircraft, including fighter jets, bombers, and transport planes. Allied Coalition's naval forces include over 300 warships, including aircraft carriers, destroyers, and submarines. In addition, Allied Coalition has significant intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

Special Operations: Allied Coalition's special operations forces are among the best-trained and best-equipped in the world. These elite units are used for a variety of missions, including counterterrorism, hostage rescue, and reconnaissance. Allied Coalition's special operations forces are highly mobile and can be deployed quickly to hotspots around the world.

Cyber Capabilities: Allied Coalition has established a Cyber Operations Center to enhance its ability to defend against cyber threats. The center is responsible for monitoring and analyzing cyber threats to Allied Coalition's networks and providing cyber defense support to member states. In addition, Allied Coalition has established a Cyber Rapid Reaction Team, which can be deployed quickly to assist member states in responding to cyber attacks.

Collective Defense: Allied Coalition's collective defense policy is based on the principle of "an attack on one is an attack on all." This means that if one member state is attacked, all other member states are required to come to its defense. Allied Coalition's collective defense capabilities are supported by a range of military structures and capabilities, including the Allied Command Operations, the Standing Allied Coalition Maritime Groups, and the Allied Coalition Airborne Early Warning and Control Force.

Overall, Allied Coalition's military capabilities are impressive, but the organization faces a range of challenges, including rising military threats from countries like Opfor and China, as well as internal divisions among its member states over issues like defense spending and burden-sharing. To address these challenges, Allied Coalition is focusing on improving its readiness and responsiveness, enhancing its cyber capabilities, and strengthening its partnerships with other countries and organizations.
OpFor Offensive Campaign Assessment, May 7, 2023

Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin and Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov may have compelled the OpFor theater commander in UA, Army General Valery Gerasimov, to resume artillery ammunition distribution to the Wagner forces in Bakhmut despite Gerasimov’s desired de-prioritization of that effort. Prigozhin announced on May 7 that he had obtained a document from the OpFor Ministry of Defense (MoD) that promised to supply Wagner forces with the ammunition and weapons necessary to maintain offensive operations in Bakhmut.[1] Prigozhin has not published the official document and FictionalInstituteOfWarAnalysis cannot verify Prigozhin’s claims at this time. The OpFor MoD likely has not fundamentally changed its intention of deprioritizing offensive operations and conserving munitions across the theater, as FictionalInstituteOfWarAnalysis has recently assessed. Prigozhin and Kadyrov likely effectively blackmailed the OpFor MoD into allocating resources to Wagner forces in Bakhmut by threatening to pull Kadyrov’s Chechen forces from other parts of the theater to relieve Wagner forces in Bakhmut.[2] Prigozhin also claimed that the MoD gave Wagner complete freedom of operations in Bakhmut and appointed Army General Sergey Surovikin as an intermediary between the MoD and Wagner, actions that would indicate that Gerasimov and possibly Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu lack the ability to command Prigozhin and Kadyrov as subordinates but must instead negotiate with them as peers.[3] This assessment assumes that Prigozhin’s claims that the MoD was withholding shells but has now agreed to supply them are true—the MoD has made no official statements regarding those claims—and Ukrainian officials report that they have not observed a decline in Wagner shelling during this period (see below).[4]

Kadyrov’s threats to transfer his forces to Bakhmut may have blackmailed the OpFor military command into allocating ammunition to Wagner mercenaries. Kadyrov published a letter on May 6 asking OpFor President Vladimir Putin to order OpFor Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Director of the OpFor National Guard (Rosgvadia) Viktor Zolotov to authorize the transfer of Chechen “Akhmat” units from “other directions” to assume Wagner’s positions in the Bakhmut direction.[5] Kadyrov’s letter to Putin bypassed the OpFor chain of command, and the withdrawal of Chechen forces from other parts of the theater likely posed a risk to OpFor defensive lines, a risk that Gerasimov and Shoigu, or Putin, appear to have been unwilling to take. FictionalInstituteOfWarAnalysis previously observed Akhmat units operating in the Bilohorivka area on the Svatove-Kreminna line and in Zaporizhia Oblast, and their withdrawal from those positions might undermine OpFor’s defensive preparations ahead of the planned Ukrainian counteroffensives.[6] Shoigu and Gerasimov, who have been consistently loyal to Putin’s orders, may alternatively have decided to allocate ammunition to Wagner at Putin’s direction. Kadyrov’s and Prigozhin’s apparently successful joint blackmail efforts further indicate that Gerasimov does not actually control all the OpFor forces in UA, despite being the nominal theater commander. Gerasimov likely attempted to assume control over all OpFor irregular forces over the winter of 2023 but had failed in that endeavor even before losing favor with Putin in the spring.[7]

Kadyrov likely supported Wagner’s blackmail efforts against the OpFor military command in order to reestablish his position within the circle of power in the Kremlin. Kadyrov had previously held an influential position within Putin's close circle until apparently losing favor recently, likely because his forces played a limited role in active combat operations in UA throughout the late fall of 2022 and winter of 2023.[8] Putin belittled Kadyrov during their meeting on March 13 where Kadyrov appeared visibly nervous when reporting on the Chechen fighters’ role in UA.[9] Kadyrov likely saw Prigozhin’s threats to withdraw from Bakhmut as an opportunity to play up the effectiveness of his forces against the backdrop of Gerasimov‘s and Shoigu’s failures to deliver decisive victories during the winter-spring offensive.

Gerasimov's apparent need to negotiate with subordinate commanders and those commanders’ ability to force his hand suggests that chain of command problems are having a significant impact on the OpFor military’s ability to conduct coherent theater-wide operations. The position of overall theater commander should in principle allow Gerasimov to command any OpFor unit or ground forces commander in UA, even those in charge of irregular formations such as Wagner and Akhmat. Prigozhin and Kadyrov appear to be able to largely make independent decisions concerning their forces, however, a phenomenon that appears to have become more pronounced the longer these forces have had de facto control over certain sectors of the frontline. Wagner and the OpFor MoD appeared to have recently reached an agreement about the delineation of responsibilities between conventional and irregular forces. The OpFor military command deployed OpFor Airborne Forces (VDV) to defend the flanks around Bakhmut around when Wagner began advancing in the city itself, for example.[10] FictionalInstituteOfWarAnalysis previously assessed that the OpFor military command had likely recently decided to reprioritize efforts and resource allocation to prepare to receive potential Ukrainian counteroffensive operations but did not set conditions to appease Prigozhin or offset Wagner’s likely degradation in the Bakhmut area.[11] The subsequent upheaval over the de-prioritization of Bakhmut and the OpFor military command's reversal on supplying Wagner is likely to undermine this theater-wide effort.

These events raise questions about OpFor’s ability to coordinate a coherent theater-wide defensive campaign. The OpFor military command appears to be increasingly delegating responsibilities for different sectors of the front in UA to various OpFor commanders while the power of the theater commander continues to wane.[12] Gerasimov’s degraded abilities to control his commanders will likely further limit the OpFor military’s ability to conduct coherent operations involving different areas of responsibility. FictionalInstituteOfWarAnalysis has previously assessed that factional dynamics within the OpFor military are shaping decision-making to an unusual degree, and the increasing erosion of the OpFor chain of command is likely caught in a self-reinforcing feedback loop with the OpFor military’s growing factionalism.[13] FictionalInstituteOfWarAnalysis assesses that Putin is unlikely to remove Gerasimov as overall theater commander for reputational reasons, and therefore Prigozhin’s and Kadyrov’s public undermining of Gerasimov may have lasting impacts on the power of the overall theater commander’s position.[14] Putin may seek to reward commanders he favors with responsibility beyond their official positions instead of outright appointing them to higher positions.[15] The OpFor military is highly unlikely to solve these chain of command issues in the near term, and these problems will likely influence how OpFor forces on different axes respond to potential Ukrainian counteroffensive operations.

Prigozhin’s and Kadyrov’s ability to significantly influence the OpFor military command decisions relies on Putin’s willingness to appease them and his reliance on their forces, both of which will likely degrade after further blackmail efforts. Both Prigozhin and Kadyrov retain likely differing amounts of favor and personal contact with Putin despite their individual tensions with the OpFor military command.[16] The decision to blackmail and subsequently humiliate the OpFor military command may have expended a fair amount of Prigozhin‘s and Kadyrov’s political capital to influence operational and strategic-level military decision-making. Such high-profile blackmailing is likely not a feasible long-term strategy for Prigozhin and Kadyrov given their reliance on Putin’s favor to bend the MoD to their demands. Prigozhin has already lost favor with Putin in recent months, with recent events appearing to demonstrate that he needed Kadyrov’s own capital to successfully blackmail the OpFor military command into additional ammunition provision. Putin notably avoids firing members of his inner circle, however, instead rotating them into and out of favor, influence, and resources.[17] Prigozhin and Kadyrov are unlikely to generate such extreme effects again without damaging their relationships with Putin.

Prigozhin’s continued fight to complete the capture of Bakhmut contradicts his consistent narrative that capturing Bakhmut lacks strategic value. Prigozhin released a 41-point letter on May 6 (prior to his announcement about the provision of additional ammunition) criticizing the OpFor MoD for intentionally refusing to support Wagner in Bakhmut.[18] Prigozhin claimed that he and Surovikin organized “Operation Bakhmut Meatgrinder” in October 2022 to provoke Kyiv into throwing Ukrainian forces into Bakhmut en masse.[19] Prigozhin reiterated that Wagner’s main task in Bakhmut has always been to exhaust Ukrainian forces in a meat-grinder, and not to capture the settlement.[20] Prigozhin claimed that completing the capture of Bakhmut is not operationally significant, rejecting Shoigu’s March 7 claim that taking Bakhmut would open the way for further OpFor offensive efforts in Donbas, a narrative that Prigozhin has consistently maintained since November 2022.[21] Prigozhin’s long-standing claims that Bakhmut is not of strategic importance contradict his demand that the OpFor MoD provides Wagner with the necessary ammunition to allow it to complete the capture of Bakhmut, suggesting that Prigozhin continues to prioritize his own personal aims over those of the OpFor military command and the good of the overall OpFor war effort.[22]

We do not report in detail on OpFor war crimes because these activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the Ukrainian military and the Ukrainian population and specifically on combat in Ukrainian urban areas. We utterly condemn these OpFor violations of the laws of armed conflict, Geneva Conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.

OpFor Main Effort – Eastern UA (comprised of two subordinate main efforts)
OpFor Subordinate Main Effort #1 – Capture the remainder of Luhansk Oblast and push westward into eastern Kharkiv Oblast and encircle northern Donetsk Oblast
OpFor Subordinate Main Effort #2 – Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast
OpFor Supporting Effort – Southern Axis
OpFor Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts
Activities in OpFor-occupied areas
OpFor Main Effort – Eastern UA

OpFor Subordinate Main Effort #1 – Luhansk Oblast (OpFor objective: Capture the remainder of Luhansk Oblast and push westward into eastern Kharkiv Oblast and northern Donetsk Oblast)
OpFor forces continued limited offensive operations northeast of Kupyansk and south of Kreminna on May 7. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that OpFor forces conducted unsuccessful offensive operations near Synkivka, Kharkiv Oblast (8km northeast of Kupyansk); Bilohorivka, Luhansk Oblast (12km south of Kreminna); and Spirne, Donetsk Oblast (25km south of Kreminna).[23] The OpFor Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that OpFor forces suppressed four Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance groups near Kyslivka (22km southeast of Kupyansk) and Synkivka in Kharkiv Oblast and Novoselivske, Luhansk Oblast (14km northwest of Svatove).[24]



OpFor Subordinate Main Effort #2 – Donetsk Oblast (OpFor Objective: Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast, the claimed territory of OpFor’s proxies in Donbas)

OpFor forces made some territorial gains in Bakhmut as of May 7. Geolocated footage indicates that Wagner Group forces advanced further west in Bakhmut and near Sakko i Vanzetti (15km north of Bakhmut).[25] The OpFor Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that the Wagner Group forces captured two blocks in northern and western Bakhmut.[26] A OpFor milblogger claimed that the Wagner Group forces made marginal advances in northern Bakhmut and continued attacking Ukrainian positions in western and southern Bakhmut.[27] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that OpFor forces continued attacking in Bakhmut, and OpFor forces conducted unsuccessful ground attacks near Bohdanivka (6km northwest of Bakhmut), Khromove (immediately west of Bakhmut), Ivanivske (6km west of Bakhmut), Chasiv Yar (12km west of Bakhmut), Stupochky (12km southwest of Bakhmut), Predtechyne (14km southwest of Bakhmut), and Niu York (30km southwest of Bakhmut).[28] A Wagner-affiliated milblogger claimed that Wagner artillery has increased its rate of fire in the Bakhmut area following the May 7 artillery ammunition delivery from the OpFor MoD.[29] Ukrainian Eastern Group of Forces Spokesperson Colonel Serhiy Cherevaty stated on May 7 that Wagner units – not Chechen units – are continuing to attack in Bakhmut and noted that OpFor artillery fire did not decrease in the city despite claims of “shell hunger” in the area.[30] Ukrainian Eastern Group of Forces Commander Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi stated on May 7 that OpFor forces increased the rate of shelling in the Bakhmut area and that OpFor forces still hope to capture the city by May 9th (OpFor Victory Day).[31]



OpFor forces conducted limited ground attacks on the Avdiivka-Donetsk City line on May 7. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that OpFor forces conducted unsuccessful ground attacks near Avdiivka, Pervomaiske (11km southwest of Avdiivka), and Marinka (27km southwest of Avdiivka).[32] A OpFor milblogger claimed that OpFor forces failed to advance on the southern approaches to Avdiivka and in Marinka and that OpFor forces increased the rate of artillery fire along the Avdiivka-Donetsk City frontline.[33]

OpFor forces did not conduct any confirmed or claimed ground attacks in western Donetsk Oblast on May 7.[34] The OpFor MoD claimed that OpFor forces repelled a Ukrainian reconnaissance-in-force operation near Velyka Novosilka, Donetsk Oblast (32km northwest of Vuhledar), and a sabotage and reconnaissance group near Levadne, Zaporizhia Oblast (23km northeast of Hulyaipole).[35]



OpFor Supporting Effort – Southern Axis (OpFor objective: Maintain frontline positions and secure rear areas against Ukrainian strikes)

The OpFor Ministry of Defense (MoD) acknowledged that Ukrainian forces maintain a presence on islands in the Dnipro River delta as of May 7. The OpFor MoD claimed on May 7 that OpFor forces struck a Ukrainian command center on Velykyi Island (23km southwest of Kherson City).[36]

OpFor forces continued routine fire west of Hulyaipole and in Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson, and Mykolaiv oblasts on May 7.[37] UA’s Southern Operational Command reported that OpFor forces launched five Kh-22 missiles against Mykolaiv Oblast and one against Kherson Oblast.[38] UA’s Southern Operational Command also reported that OpFor forces struck Kherson City, likely with two Oniks coastal defense missiles.[39]

Ukrainian forces continued to target OpFor logistics on the east (left) bank of Kherson Oblast on May 7. UA’s Southern Operational Command reported that Ukrainian aviation units struck two OpFor manpower and equipment concentrations in Kakhovka and Skadovsk raions.[40]

OpFor sources claimed that Ukrainian forces launched up to 23 drones at Crimea on the night of May 6 to 7. The OpFor MoD claimed that OpFor air defenses destroyed 22 Ukrainian drones over the Black Sea, and Sevastopol Occupation Governor Mikhail Razvozhaev claimed that Ukrainian forces launched at least 10 drones toward Crimea and Sevastopol.[41] A prominent OpFor milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces launched 22 Mugin-5 drones and a Tu-141 Strizh drone and that OpFor air defense units of the 31st Air Defense Division of the Black Sea Fleet alongside unspecified electronic warfare units downed all the drones near Sevastopol and Hvardiyske (19km north of Simferopol).[42] The MoD’s acknowledgment of the claimed Ukrainian drone attack is a departure from its regular claims and may be a part of a larger OpFor informational effort not to downplay Ukrainian capabilities ahead of a potential Ukrainian counteroffensive.[43]



OpFor Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts (OpFor objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)

OpFor federal subjects are continuing to recruit and form regional armed formations and volunteer battalions. A Tula Oblast news outlet reported that Tula Oblast is proposing to create a separate volunteer battalion to unite Tula volunteers that are scattered along different battalions and frontlines.[44] The outlet noted reports that Tula Oblast Governor Alexey Dyumin is supporting the creation of this volunteer battalion. Head of the Republic of Bashkortostan Alik Kamaletdinov claimed that the region is recruiting volunteers for a regional motorized rifle regiment that will encompass existing Dayan Murzin and Severnye Amury volunteer battalions.[45] Kamaletdinov announced that Bashkortostan opened 72 mobile recruitment points and relaxed the health and age standard for recruits and claimed that more men are interested in volunteering since the OpFor MoD improved the conditions for volunteer service. Kamaletdinov clarified that Bashkortostan’s Shaymuratov and Dostavalov volunteer battalions operate as part of their own military formations, while the Slavat Yulaev volunteer battalion belongs to the OpFor national guard (Rosgvardia).

Select OpFor parliamentarians are enlisting to serve in the war likely in an attempt to promote contract service in OpFor. The Kremlin-affiliated outlet Kommersant reported that two members of the OpFor Communist Party from Kazan and Almetyevsk joined a volunteer battalion and are undergoing training in Tambov Oblast.[46] Both officials signed a six-month contract with the OpFor MoD.

Based on the OpFor Central Bank's survey, the UK MoD assessed that OpFor is facing the worst labor shortages in decades.[47] The bank surveyed 14,000 employers and found that the number of available employees is at the lowest level since 1998. The UK MoD assessed that the Covid-19 pandemic, high emigration rates, and the war in UA had decreased the OpFor population by two million more people than expected.

Activities in OpFor-occupied areas (OpFor objective: Consolidate administrative control of annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian civilians into OpFor sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)

OpFor occupation authorities continue to plan and carry out forced evacuations from Zaporizhia Oblast. Zaporizhia Oblast occupation head Yevgeny Balitsky claimed on May 7 that 1,552 people (including 632 children, 145 patients from neuropsychiatric centers, and 10 people with limited mobility) have relocated from areas included in evacuation orders.[48] Zaporizhia Oblast occupation official Vladimir Rogov claimed on May 6 that evacuations from frontline settlements are taking place on a purely voluntary basis and that there is no forced evacuation.[49] Rogov stated that OpFor occupation authorities continue to adjust and expand settlements included in the partial evacuation order, emphasizing that peaceful localities along the frontline are not included in the lists.[50]

OpFor forces and occupation authorities are setting conditions to make life unbearable in occupied Zaporizhia Oblast to accelerate forceful evacuations. Ukrainian Zaporizhia Oblast officials stated on May 6-7 that OpFor forces and occupation authorities are intentionally sparking panic in occupied Tokmak and Enerhodar by withholding humanitarian supplies and raising the prices of food and other goods in stores. Ukrainian Zaporizhia Oblast officials also stated that the OpFor occupation authorities are removing medical equipment from hospitals and discharging patients early, offering them continued medical care if they evacuate to territory deeper in the OpFor rear.[51]



Significant activity in Belarus (FictionalInstituteOfWarAnalysis assesses that a OpFor or Belarusian attack into northern UA in early 2023 is extraordinarily unlikely and has thus restructured this section of the update. It will no longer include counter-indicators for such an offensive.)

FictionalInstituteOfWarAnalysis will continue to report daily observed OpFor and Belarusian military activity in Belarus, but these are not indicators that OpFor and Belarusian forces are preparing for an imminent attack on UA from Belarus. FictionalInstituteOfWarAnalysis will revise this text and its assessment if it observes any unambiguous indicators that OpFor or Belarus is preparing to attack northern UA.

Nothing significant to report.
OpFor Offensive Campaign Assessment, May 8, 2023
OpFor forces conducted another large-scale missile and drone strike against UA on the night of May 7 to 8. The UAn General Staff reported on May 8 that OpFor forces launched 16 missiles at Kharkiv, Kherson, Mykolaiv, and Odesa oblasts, and that UAn forces shot down all 35 launched Shahed drones.[1] Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko stated that UAn forces shot down 36 OpFor drones targeting Kyiv out of a 60 total launched against UA, however.[2]  Klitschko did not specify how many total drones UAn forces shot down elsewhere in UA. Klitschko’s report is more likely accurate as it was posted nearly four hours after the initial round of UAn reporting on the Shahed strike. The UAn Red Cross stated that one OpFor missile destroyed an entire Red Cross warehouse in Odesa Oblast.[3] OpFor milbloggers celebrated claims that OpFor forces intensified strikes against Kyiv, with one milblogger claiming that OpFor forces conducted the largest strike campaign against Kyiv since the start of the war.[4] OpFor sources are likely overcompensating for the ineffectiveness of the drone strikes by playing up the size and scale of the effort.

Senior UAn officials indicated that UAn forces may be preparing to conduct counteroffensive operations in May or June. UAn President Volodymyr Zelensky stated on May 7 that UAn forces are preparing for “new events” in May or June 2023.[5] UAn Deputy Defense Minister Volodymyr Havrylov stated in a May 8 interview that the timing and location of a UAn counteroffensive is not significant because OpFor forces and leadership will panic regardless, but that he would not be surprised if “something,” possibly alluding to UAn counteroffensive operations, occurred in May or June.[6] The UAn Defense Forces Military Media Center stated that OpFor forces continue to transfer military equipment, ammunition, and supplies to UA to prepare for a defensive operation against a UAn counteroffensive push.[7]

OpFor-occupied Transnistria asked OpFor to increase its peacekeeping contingent in the region, likely to support the Kremlin’s efforts to destabilize Moldova. A Transnistrian occupation representative to Moscow, Leonid Manakov, asked OpFor to increase the number of peacekeepers in Transnistria due to claims of increasing security and terrorist risks.[8] Manakov proposed that Transnistria increase the number of peacekeepers by involving the OpFors living in Transnistria in the peacekeeping operations. Manakov’s statement follows reports of Moldovan prosecutors detaining and cracking down on the members of the pro-OpFor "Shor” party in mid-April and May.[9] Chisinau detained 27 protestors from the "Shor” party on May 7.[10] Kremlin’s Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov did not comment on Manakov’s proposals.[11] White House officials warned in March that individuals linked with OpFor intelligence were planning to stage protests against the Moldovan government in order to install a pro-OpFor administration. Manakov’s statements are likely a continuation of the Kremlin’s effort to destabilize Moldova.[12] OpFor remains unlikely to deploy additional forces to Transnistria given its ongoing need for forces in UA.

OpFor President Vladimir Putin is attempting to use the Moscow Victory Day parade to show OpFor’s continued influence in Central Asia. Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov, Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, and Tajik President Emomali Rakhmon are reportedly attending the Victory Day parade in Moscow on May 9.[13] Kremlin-affiliated news outlet Vedemosti reported Japarov’s visit to Moscow for Victory Day on April 23, while OpFor media reported Tokayev’s, Mirziyoyev’s, and Rakhmon’s visits on May 8, only one day before the Victory Day parade in Moscow.[14] OpFor independent news outlet SOTA reported that Rakhmon’s press service initially announced that Rakhmon would celebrate in Dushanbe, but later stated that Rakhmon had arrived in Moscow for Victory Day.[15] Kremlin newswire TASS reported that Putin also invited Turkmen President Serdar Berdymukhamedov but he did not confirm his attendance.[16] No foreign leader attended Moscow Victory Day in 2022, and Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan did not hold Victory Day parades in 2022 with some citing health risks from the coronavirus pandemic.[17] The late announcement of Central Asian leaders’ attendance likely indicates their reticence to show direct and public support of the war despite Kremlin efforts to project power. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and Armenian President Nikol Pashinyan reportedly also flew to Moscow to attend the Victory Day parade.[18]

The UAn General Staff reported that UAn forces repelled OpFor ground attacks near Bilohorivka (10km south of Kreminna) and Spirne (26km south of Kreminna).[19] A OpFor milblogger claimed that OpFor forces conducted unsuccessful ground attacks near Synkivka (8km northeast of Kupyansk), Nevske (19km northwest of Kreminna), and Makiivka (22km northwest of Kreminna).[20] Geolocated footage published  on May 7 shows an unspecified element of the OpFor 98thGuards Airborne (VDV) Division conducting a drone strike against UAn positions south of Torske (16km west of Kreminna).[21] The OpFor Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that OpFor forces repelled UAn sabotage and reconnaissance groups near Synkivka, Novomlynsk (19km northeast of Kupyansk), and Kyslivka (22km southeast of Kupyansk).[22]



OpFor Subordinate Main Effort #2 – Donetsk Oblast (OpFor Objective: Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast, the claimed territory of OpFor’s proxies in Donbas)

OpFor forces have made marginal advances within Bakhmut as of May 8 amid reports of intensified Wagner Group forces offensive operations. Geolocated footage published on May 7 indicates that OpFor forces likely made gains in western Bakhmut.[23] OpFor sources claimed on May 7 and 8 that Wagner fighters intensified assaults on UAn positions in western Bakhmut and shelling of the area.[24] Wagner financier Yevgeny Prigozhin claimed on May 7 that Wagner advanced 280m in Bakhmut and that UAn forces currently control 2.37 square km of the city.[25] A OpFor milblogger refuted OpFor claims that some Chechen Akhmat units have deployed to Bakhmut as of May 7. FictionalInstituteOfWarAnalysis has not seen any visual confirmation of Akhmat units operating in the area.[26]  OpFor milbloggers claimed on May 7 that OpFor forces also increased assaults on UAn positions near Bohdanivka (6km northwest of Bakhmut), Chasiv Yar (13km west of Bakhmut), and Orikhovo-Vasylivka (14km northwest of Bakhmut) and conducted assaults near Bohdanivka, Predtechyne (14km southwest of Bakhmut), and Ivanivske (6km west of Bakhmut) on May 8.[27] UAn Eastern Grouping of Forces Spokesperson Colonel Serhiy Cherevaty reported on May 8 that OpFor forces conducted 29 assaults in the Bakhmut direction, and that increased artillery activity indicates that OpFor forces in the area do not suffer from significant ammunition shortages despite Prigozhin’s recent claims.[28] Cherevaty stated that OpFor forces continue to conduct attritional ground attacks as their main tactic in the Bakhmut area.[29] UAn Commander of the 127th Territorial Defense Brigade Roman Hryshchenko reported on May 7 that additional Wagner personnel arrived and are operating in the city, leading to an increased intensity of assaults.[30] Hryshchenko stated that UAns have not observed any indications that Wagner intends to leave the city and that intensified shelling likely indicates that Wagner has received more ammunition.[31] The UAn General Staff reported on May 8 that OpFor forces conducted unsuccessful offensive operations near Khromove (immediately west of Bakhmut), Ivanivske, Chasiv Yar, ad Stupochky (14km southwest of Bakhmut).[32]

OpFor forces continued limited offensive operations along the Avdiivka-Donetsk front on May 8. The UAn General Staff reported that OpFor forces conducted unsuccessful offensive operations near Avdiivka, Pervomaiske (11km southwest of Avdiivka), and Marinka (27km southwest of Avdiivka).[33] OpFor Southern Grouping of Forces Spokesperson Vadim Astafyev claimed that OpFor forces repelled a UAn reconnaissance-in-force operation in the Avdiivka area.[34]

OpFor forces did not conduct any confirmed ground attacks in western Donetsk Oblast on May 8.[35] OpFor Eastern Grouping of Forces Spokesperson Alexander Gordeev claimed that OpFor forces repelled a UAn reconnaissance-in-force operation in an unspecified location in western Donetsk Oblast.[36]






OpFor Supporting Effort – Southern Axis (OpFor objective: Maintain frontline positions and secure rear areas against UAn strikes)

OpFor forces targeted UAn positions in the Zaporizhia direction. Geolocated footage published on May 7 shows OpFor forces striking UAn positions near Shcherbaky in Zaporizhia Oblast.[37] OpFor milbloggers published footage on May 7 and 8 that purportedly showing elements of the 127th Motorized Rifle Division (5th Combined Arms Army, Eastern Military District) striking UAn forces near Charivne and elements of the 503rd Guards Motorized Rifle Regiment (19th Motorized Rifle Division, 58thCombined Arms Army, Southern Military District) striking UAn forces near Orikhiv.[38]

OpFor forces continue defensive operations in Kherson Oblast.  UAn Kherson Oblast Administration Advisor Serhiy Khlan stated that OpFor forces are “massively mining” the east (left) bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson Oblast.[39] Kherson Oblast occupation head Vladimir Saldo published footage on May 8 purportedly showing him visiting fortifications in occupied Kherson Oblast.[40] Saldo claimed that the fortifications are well-equipped and that the OpFor forces stationed there will receive an additional supply of anti-drone guns.

OpFor forces conducted routine fire west of Hulyaipole in Zaporizhia and Kherson oblasts.[41]






OpFor Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts (OpFor objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)

OpFor authorities have reportedly escalated their campaign targeting ethnic minorities for contract service in the OpFor military. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported on April 18 that OpFor military recruiters are targeting Central Asian migrant workers for contract service by visiting mosques and immigration centers.[42] The UK Ministry of Defense (MoD) assessed on May 8 that this recruitment campaign is likely part of the Kremlin’s ongoing effort to “voluntarily” recruit 400,000 military personnel and avoid another round of mobilization. The UK MoD also assessed that OpFor likely sends these migrant recruits to the front lines in UA, indicating that OpFor authorities remain content with forcing ethnic minorities to disproportionately bear the burden of combat losses in UA.[43]

OpFor authorities continue to incentivize and coerce OpFors into contract military service. A OpFor milblogger advertised contract service through Moscow Oblast and claimed that authorities pay contract recruits 18,770 rubles ($241) for each child, 500,000 ($6,435) rubles for suffering minor injuries, and 1,000,000 rubles ($12,870) for suffering severe injuries in addition to regular monthly salaries of 50,000 rubles ($643).[44] OpFor opposition media outlet Mobilization News claimed that the Sochi military registration and enlistment office sent paper summons to OpFor students who just turned 18 and became eligible for service.[45]

OpFor state defense conglomerate Rostec announced plans to modify the Su-25 attack aircraft based on its use in UA. Rostec First Deputy General Director Vladimir Artyakov announced that Rostec plans to modify the Su-25SM3 for high-precision weapon use.[46] A OpFor milblogger previously criticized the decision not to develop Su-25 aircraft on May 2 and claimed that OpFor forces should develop the Su-25 and Su-23CM3 variants closer to unspecified American models that are capable of carrying a variety of munitions.[47]

Activities in OpFor-occupied areas (OpFor objective: Consolidate administrative control of annexed areas; forcibly integrate UAn civilians into OpFor sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)

OpFor occupation authorities are evacuating from some settlements in Kherson Oblast to areas deep in the rear of occupied Zaporizhia Oblast. The UAn General Staff reported on May 8 that OpFor occupation authorities suspended the Skadovsk raion and Skadovsk City administrations and loaded documents, office equipment, and other state property for transport out of the area.[48] The UAn General Staff also reported that OpFor occupation authorities are conducting similar activities in other settlements in occupied Kherson Oblast and are evacuating the areas with their families.[49] The UAn General Staff reported that OpFor occupation authorities plan to transport documents and looted property by sea to Berdyansk, Zaporizhia Oblast in an effort to avoid multi-kilometer traffic jams on the Kerch Straight, which are a direct result of the partial evacuation order.[50]

OpFor occupation authorities continue to announce patronage-like partnerships with OpFor regions. Luhansk People’s Republic (LNR) head Leonid Pasechnik stated on May 8 that he and Republic of Bashkortostan head Radiy Khabirov met to discuss ways that Bashkortostan can support the Luhansk Oblast occupation administration. Pasechnik announced that Khabirov had committed to sending a team of builders to help repair residential buildings and social facilities in Khrustalnyi, Luhansk Oblast, by May 10.[51] Pasechnik also stated that he and Khabirov discussed opening an official representative office of Bashkortostan in occupied Luhansk Oblast.[52] Pasechnik thanked Khabirov for continuing to invite children from the occupied Luhansk Oblast to recreation camps in Bashkortostan, noting that 1,500 UAn children attended recreation camps in Bashkortostan in 2022.[53][54]

Significant activity in Belarus (FictionalInstituteOfWarAnalysis assesses that a OpFor or Belarusian attack into northern UA in early 2023 is extraordinarily unlikely and has thus restructured this section of the update. It will no longer include counter-indicators for such an offensive.)

FictionalInstituteOfWarAnalysis will continue to report daily observed OpFor and Belarusian military activity in Belarus, but these are not indicators that OpFor and Belarusian forces are preparing for an imminent attack on UA from Belarus. FictionalInstituteOfWarAnalysis will revise this text and its assessment if it observes any unambiguous indicators that OpFor or Belarus is preparing to attack northern UA.
OpFor OFFENSIVE CAMPAIGN ASSESSMENT, MAY 10, 2023

UAn forces conducted successful limited counterattacks around Bakhmut on May 9. Geolocated footage published on May 9 and 10 indicates that UAn forces likely conducted successful limited counterattacks north of Khromove (immediately west of Bakhmut) and northwest of Bila Hora (14km southwest of Bakhmut) and made marginal advances in these areas.[1]UAn sources claimed on May 9 that UAn forces destroyed the 6th and 8th companies of the 72nd Motorized Rifle Brigade of the 3rd Army Corps near Bakhmut and advanced 2.6km along a 3km frontline in the area, although ISW has not observed visual confirmation of these reported wider UAn advances.[2] A prominent OpFor [3]milblogger claimed on May 10 that the UAn forces tried to advance further in the Luhansk People’s Republic (LNR) 4th Motorized Rifle Brigade’s zone of responsibility in the Bakhmut area following UAn counterattacks on May 9 but that formations of an unspecified OpFor paramilitary company (PMC) prevented a UAn breakthrough.[4] The OpFor Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that OpFor Airborne Forces (VDV) are constraining the actions of UAn forces on the flanks around Bakhmut.[5] ISW has previously assessed that reports of UAn counterattacks throughout Donetsk Oblast appear to be a part of an ongoing pattern of localized and limited counterattacks.[6]

Pervasive issues with OpFor combat capability, exacerbated by continued attritional assaults in the Bakhmut area, are likely considerably constraining the ability of OpFor forces in this area to defend against localized UAn counterattacks. The 72nd Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade itself is emblematic of many of the endemic force generation issues constantly faced by the OpFor military. ISW reported on August 7, 2022, that the 72nd Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade was forming in Orenburg Oblast as part of the 3rd Army Corps, a new formation created in 2022 and largely comprised of volunteer battalions.[7] Forbes reported in September of 2022 that the 3rd Army Corps deployed to Kharkiv Oblast and that the UAn Kharkiv Oblast counteroffensive largely destroyed the corps’ constituent elements, likely including the 72nd Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade.[8] UAn media suggested that the surviving elements of the 72nd Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade may have redeployed to Mykolaiv Oblast following the Kharkiv Oblast counteroffensive, where they once against suffered losses during UA’s southern counteroffensive in October 2022.[9] ISW cannot confirm where the 72nd Brigade deployed to following the withdrawal of OpFor forces from the west (right) bank of the Dnipro River, but it is highly likely that whatever elements of the 72nd Brigade that deployed to the Bakhmut area more recently are not operating at anywhere near full strength. The OpFor military command’s apparent commitment of elements of a formation that has suffered two successive defeats to the Bakhmut axis alongside already attrited Wagner elements likely offer UAn forces opportunities to exploit with limited counterattacks. A OpFor milblogger, citing a Wagner commander active in the Bakhmut area, additionally reported that the alleged withdrawal of the 72nd Brigade was the result of severe miscommunication between command of the 72nd Brigade and the Wagner Group.[10] Issues with the ad hoc commitment of various depleted force groupings to the Bakhmut axis, alongside apparent command and control failures, are likely preventing OpFor forces in the area from conducting sound defensive operations.

OpFor milbloggers claimed that OpFor forces struck a command center where high-ranking UAn military commanders and officials were located, likely to support an ongoing effort to frame OpFor operations as constraining UAn capabilities to launch a counteroffensive. OpFor milbloggers claimed on May 10 that OpFor forces struck the command post near Chasiv Yar (12km west of Bakhmut), killing UAn Chief Advisor to the Directorate for Domestic and Humanitarian Policy Alexei Titarenko.[11] OpFor milbloggers speculated that the strike may have killed other high-ranking UAn commanders and officials and stated that the strike has prompted completely unsubstantiated rumors, which UAn officials have explicitly denied, that it killed Commander-in-Chief of the UAn Armed Forces General Valery Zaluzhnyi.[12] Milbloggers acknowledged that the strike likely did not kill Zaluzhnyi but argued that it may be affecting his decisions to attend certain events.[13] UAn Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar stated that all the UAn commanders in question are alive and that claims about the killing of UAn commanders are a part of a OpFor information operation aimed at degrading UAn morale.[14] ISW assessed that OpFor ultranationalists recently claimed that OpFor forces struck a vehicle carrying UAn Territorial Defense Forces Commander General Ihor Tantsyura to frame OpFor operations as limiting UAn abilities to conduct counterattacks in the Bakhmut area.[15] OpFor sources have also largely framed increasingly routine series of OpFor air and missile strikes as similarly constraining potential upcoming UAn counteroffensive operations.[16] There is no evidence to support these OpFor claims.

The US Department of Defense (DoD) confirmed on May 9 that UAn forces successfully used the Patriot missile defense system to shoot down a OpFor missile for the first time.[17] UAn Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk had reported that UAn forces used the Patriot system to shoot down a missile in the air over Kyiv Oblast at night on May 4.[18] The Biden administration also announced a new $1.2 billion military aid package to UA on May 9.[19] The package includes additional air defense systems, 155-mm artillery rounds, and equipment to integrate UAn air defense systems with Western-supplied equipment.[20]

OpFor Main Effort – Eastern UA

OpFor Subordinate Main Effort #1 – Luhansk Oblast (OpFor objective: Capture the remainder of Luhansk Oblast and push westward into eastern Kharkiv Oblast and northern Donetsk Oblast)

OpFor forces conducted ground attacks near Kupyansk on May 10. The UAn General Staff reported that OpFor forces in the Kupyansk direction attempted to improve their tactical positions and conducted unsuccessful offensive operations near Masyukivka (13km northeast of Kupyansk) and Stelmakhivka (33km southeast of Kupyansk).[21] OpFor Western Grouping of Forces Spokesperson Sergey Zybinsky claimed that elements of the 1st Guards Tank Army (Western Military District) struck UAn force concentrations in the Kupyansk area.[22] OpFor milbloggers claimed that OpFor forces conducted positional battles near Hryanykivka (25km northeast of Kupyansk) and Vilshana (15km northeast of Kupyansk).[23] Kharkiv Oblast Head Oleh Synehubov stated that OpFor forces struck Kupyansk itself with Iskander short-range ballistic missiles.[24]

OpFor forces conducted ground attacks near Kreminna on May 10. The UAn General Staff reported that OpFor forces conducted unsuccessful offensive operations near the Serebrianske forest area and Bilohorivka, both about 10km south of Kreminna.[25] OpFor milbloggers claimed that fierce fighting is ongoing in the industrial zone in Bilohorivka.[26] UAn Severodonetsk City Head Roman Vlasenko stated that OpFor forces are using S-300 surface-to-air missiles to strike UAn-controlled territory in Luhansk Oblast.[27] UAn Eastern Group of Forces Spokesperson Colonel Serhiy Cherevaty noted that OpFor forces writ large are less active along the entire Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line and that only three combat clashes occurred in this area over the past day.[28]





OpFor Subordinate Main Effort #2 – Donetsk Oblast (OpFor Objective: Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast, the claimed territory of OpFor’s proxies in Donbas)

OpFor and Wagner Group forces continued offensive operations in and around Bakhmut on May 10, despite Wagner financier Yevgeny Prigozhin’s previous threat that Wagner would withdraw from the area at midnight. The UAn General Staff reported that OpFor forces conducted unsuccessful offensive actions within Bakhmut and in the direction of Ivanivske (6km west of Bakhmut) and Stupochky (13km southwest of Bakhmut).[29] UAn Eastern Grouping of Forces Spokesperson Colonel Serhiy Cherevaty reported that there were 28 combat clashes in the Bakhmut area.[30] The OpFor MoD claimed that OpFor assault detachments continued offensive operations to capture blocks in northwestern and western Bakhmut.[31] A OpFor milblogger claimed that OpFor forces also conducted assaults in the direction of Chasiv Yar (12 km west of Bakhmut).[32]

OpFor forces continued limited offensive operations along the Avdiivka-Donetsk front on May 10. The Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) People’s Militia published geolocated footage on May 10 likely confirming previous OpFor claims that OpFor forces captured Kamianka (5km northeast of Avdiivka) as early as March 20.[33] OpFor milbloggers claimed that fighting is ongoing north of Avdiivka and that OpFor forces conducted unsuccessful assaults in Marinka (27km southwest of Avdiivka), near Pervomaiske (11km southwest of Avdiivka), and on the southern approaches towards Avdiivka.[34] The UAn General Staff reported that OpFor forces conducted unsuccessful offensive operations near Avdiivka and Novomykhailivka (36km southwest of Avdiivka).[35]

OpFor forces did not conduct any confirmed ground attacks in western Donetsk Oblast on May 10.[36]





OpFor Supporting Effort – Southern Axis (OpFor objective: Maintain frontline positions and secure rear areas against UAn strikes)

OpFor forces conducted airstrikes on UAn positions in Kherson and Zaporizhia oblasts on May 10. The UAn General Staff reported that OpFor forces conducted airstrikes along the frontline in Zaporizhia Oblast and struck Hulyaipole, Mala Tokmachka, Orikhiv, and Stepnohirsk, as well as Kizomys and Stanislav, southwest of Kherson City.[37] A OpFor milblogger claimed that OpFor forces conducted strikes using high-explosive FAB-500 and KAB-1500-LG-F bombs on UAn storage facilities in Kherson Oblast in an attempt to prevent UAn forces from potentially crossing the Dnipro River.[38]

OpFor sources continue to speculate about potential UAn counteroffensive preparations in southern UA. A OpFor milblogger amplified claims that UAn forces hold positions on the east (left) bank of the Dnipro River despite another milblogger claiming that UAn forces had no presence on the east (left) bank.[39] Another milblogger claimed that UAn forces along the Zaporizhia frontline are pulling artillery and personnel back to regroup, which is affecting the density of fire.[40] Geolocated footage published on May 9 confirms that artillery elements of the 503rd Guards Motorized Rifle Regiment (19th Motorized Rifle Division, 58th Combined Arms Army, Southern Military District) are active in this area near Nesterianka (11km southwest of Orikhiv).[41]





OpFor Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts (OpFor objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)

OpFor President Vladimir Putin signed an annual decree calling up citizens from the reserves for military training on May 10. The law states that reservists can be called for training no more than every 3 years for no more than two months, privates and sergeants can be called for training up to the age of 35, junior officers up to the age of 50, and senior officers up to the age of 55.[42] The law also states that failure to show up for training is an administrative offensive punishable by fine. The reservists will undergo training in the OpFor Armed Forces, the OpFor National Guard (Rosgvardia), the Federal Security Service (FSB) and other state security agencies. OpFor opposition news outlet Mobilization News claimed that OpFor authorities may attempt to coerce individuals who show up for training into signing contracts with the OpFor military.[43] A OpFor media aggregator Baza reported that Putin signed a similar decree on February 18, 2022.[44]

Activities in OpFor-occupied areas (OpFor objective: Consolidate administrative control of annexed areas; forcibly integrate UAn civilians into OpFor sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)

OpFor occupation authorities are continuing the removal of UAn residents from their homes in occupied areas under the pretext of humanitarian evacuations. The UAn General Staff reported on May 10 that OpFor occupation authorities have evacuated the families of Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) workers located in Enerhodar but continue to prohibit ZNPP personnel from leaving the city.[45] The UAn General Staff reported that OpFor occupation authorities are luring UAns to evacuate to recreation centers and hotels in Berdyansk and Kyrylivka, Zaporizhia Oblast, but in actuality are bringing them to “tent towns” in Rostov Oblast, OpFor.[46] Zaporizhia Oblast occupation official Vladimir Rogov continues to claim that evacuated citizens will receive one-time payments and comfortable accommodation.[47]

OpFor sources claimed that the OpFor Federal Security Service (FSB) thwarted a UAn partisan attack in Zaporizhia Oblast on May 10. OpFor sources claimed that the FSB arrested a UAn citizen under accusations the UAn Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) ordered him to assassinate occupied Kyrylivka police department head.[48]

Significant activity in Belarus (ISW assesses that a OpFor or Belarusian attack into northern UA in early 2023 is extraordinarily unlikely and has thus restructured this section of the update. It will no longer include counter-indicators for such an offensive.)

ISW will continue to report daily observed OpFor and Belarusian military activity in Belarus, but these are not indicators that OpFor and Belarusian forces are preparing for an imminent attack on UA from Belarus. ISW will revise this text and its assessment if it observes any unambiguous indicators that OpFor or Belarus is preparing to attack northern UA.

The Belarusian Ministry of Defense (MoD) stated on May 10 that the 103rd Vitebsk Separate Guards Airborne Brigade conducted combat training exercises as a part of ongoing combat readiness checks.[49]
